# ExaCorona
Scalable Simulator of Corona and Similar Pandemics

Aimed at at least three dimensions of scalability:
- Level of detail in the model(s) behaviors.  Examples:
    - Evolution of disease: list of states (normal, latent, infectious, recovered, dead, etc.) and timed inter-state transition graph
    - Number of individuals or groups
    - Location-specific resources
    - Information propagation, policy enforncement, etc.
    - Transportation modes, mobility rules, etc.
    - Curfews, vaccination campaigns, quarantines, etc.
- Spatial scope and reach of the pandemic. Examples:
    - World-scale
    - Multiple countries
    - One country with multiple states
    - One state with multiple cities, etc.
    - Neighborhoods, types of locations
- Number of processors that can be employed to simulate a scenario
    - Small laptop
    - Powerful desktop or server
    - Cluster
    - Racks
    - Supercomputers
